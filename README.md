### tacobot-detection

This list contains most of tacobot.tf members and people associated with the project.
It can be used together with pazer's TF2 Bot Detector to keep the toxic nonsense out of your game.

Get TF2 Bot Detector here: https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector

Drop all files in the .zip into (tf2 bot detector folder)/cfg and it'll get imported.
There's also a small guide on how to set it up: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2249430032

A few notes to consider: Please do not hunt down individuals of this list, it is purely made to avoid as much conflicts as possible when playing Mann vs Machine.
There are still exceptions with similar behaviour patterns who don't have any connections to said project and therefore do not count to this project.

Points I'd consider when adding individual people: **website tag**, **friends of tb.tf**, **specific invite-only groups shared with other members**, **negative steam comments**, **negative groups about mvm**, **keywords such as "gaspasser pyro ape"**, **known to troll people**

If I can't find clear connections to said group, the person does not get added to the list but gets stored instead for further investigation.
People who behave or pretend to be like those and its not a clear sign of just fooling around however still get added. You wouldn't pretend to steal just to look like an actual thief, right?

Also there's a high chance there may be false-positives, I get that. People who find themselves on the list and think they may not fit the category may text me on steam and we'll sort things out. There's a good chance I can counter-argument though, so please don't fool me. The list won't have a big impact on your further gameplay but please be nicer to new players in the future. If you don't think you can manage to to so, maybe consider playing in a full lobby or even try to take a break, i'll be worth it for the long shot.
